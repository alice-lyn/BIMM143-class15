## What is in the PDB database 

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB < www.rcsb.org >. 

Let's see what this database contains: 

```{r}
url  <- "Data Export Summary.csv"
stats <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

The function `as.numeric` can turn strings into numbers
```{r}
as.numeric(c(10,"1000"))
```

```{r}
as.numeric(stats$X.ray)
```

How to get rid of the commas? 
```{r}
sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", stats$X.ray)))
```

Turning it into a fucntion: 
```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / n.total
```
X.ray: 0.8412978005 * 100 = 84.12978005 %
EM: 0.0921374464 * 100 = 9.21374464 %

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
189750/n.total * 100
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

248805733 - 219140
```{r}
219140/248805733 * 100
```



## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* ("molstar") is a web-based molecular viewer

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The two H atoms are smaller than the resolution can catch, so it's not on the image. 


## Working with the bio3d package 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```



## Predicting functional motions of a single structure 

We can do a bioinformatics prediction 

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb) 
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
