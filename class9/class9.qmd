## Import data
```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```


## Data exploration 

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset? 

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```
There are `r nrow(candy)` candy types in the dataset. 

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset? 

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> How many chocolate candies are in the dataset? 

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```


## My favourite candy 

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

```{r}
#library("skimr")
#skim(candy)
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Chocolate, fruity, caramel, peanutyalmondy, nougat, crispedricewafer, hard, bar, pluribus are all either 0 or 1 values. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 stands for FALSE and 1 stands for TRUE. 

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 7)
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
It's below 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

- first find all chocolate candies
- find their winpercent values
- calculate the mean of these values 
- then do the same for fruity candies and compare their means

```{r}
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds,]$winpercent
mean(chocolate.win)
```

```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

another approach: 
```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```
Chocolate candies are higher ranked than fruity candies. 

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruit.win)
```

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

The `order` function returns the indices that make the input sorted. 

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height = 10) 
```

![image_B&W](mybarplot.png)


## Adding color  

```{r}
my_cols=rep("tan4", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Reese's Peanut Butter cup

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst


## Pricepercent 

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```
There are too many labels in this plot; let's use ggrepel to solve the problem. 

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3, max.overlaps=20)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Tootsie Roll Midgies

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip, Nestle Smarties, Ring pop, Mr Good Bar, and Hershey's special dark. Nik L Nip is the least popular. 


## 5 Exploring the correlation 

```{r}
library(corrplot) 
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruit 

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar


## Principal component analysis 

Do we need to scale the data before PCA? 
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col = my_cols, pch=16)
```

Making a ggplot version of this figure: 
```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
head(my_data)
```
```{r}
ggplot(my_data) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(my_data)) + 
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
```
Make this a bit nicer 


```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}

#library(plotly)
#ggplotly(p)
```

How to the original variables contribute to out PCs? for this we look at the loadings component of our results object i.e. the `pca$rotation` object. 

```{r}
head(pca$rotation)
```
```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(res) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(res), PC1)) + 
  geom_col()
```
> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruit, pluribus, and hard are picked up by PC1 in the positive direction. These make sense to me because these characteristics usually appear together in a candy product.
